The 59-year-old is set to be sacked if his side lose at home to Nottingham Foreston Saturday, reports the Times. But the PA news agency understands the former Manchester United boss still has credit in the bank with the  West Ham board, despite the Hammers dropping into the Premier League relegation zone.\nLeeds have also fallen into the bottom three, following last Saturdays loss at Everton and their sacking of Jesse Marsch a fortnight ago. Fabrizio Romano writes in the Guardian that the Yorkshire club are looking to turn things around and are in talks with ex-Watford and Valencia manager Javi Gracia, 52, over the vacant managerial position.\nManchester City could reportedly dash Arsenals summer hopes by making another attempt to recruit Declan Rice. The West Ham captain, 24, is expected to leave his club in the search for trophies. The Times says Gunners boss Mikel Artetawas quietly confident of signing his top summer target, but 90min reports the reigning Premier League champions may look to sign the midfielder as a replacement if Ilkay Gundogan, Kalvin Phillips or Bernardo Silva choose to leave the Etihad.\nChelseas plan to send teenage midfielder Andrey Santos on loan to Palmeiras appears to have stalled. The Standard says the 18-year-old chose the club in his native Brazil due to their status and reputation for developing youth players. The papers adds that the sticking point in negotiations has been the length of his stay, with the Blues wanting him back for next season and the Sao Paolo side preferring to keep the player until December.\nRecommended",

Per UEFAs rules, any player that accumulates three bookings will face an automatic one-match suspension, with the tally wiped clear at the quarter-final stage.\nAs the full-back picked up yellows in both home wins against Napoliand Rangers if he is booked by referee Istvan Kovacs then he will miss the return leg in the Spanish capital. Alexander-Arnold has been shown a yellow just three times in 22 Premier League appearances so far this campaign but is up against one of the toughest players in the world to mark in Vinicius Jr.\nThe Englandman did avoid a yellow in last seasons final against the Brazilian but will need to remain cautious as Alexander-Arnolds deputy at right-back Calvin Ramsay is unavailable for both legs due to injury. The Scottish summer signing is set to miss the remainder of the season after undergoing surgery on his back.\nJUST IN:\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp will be hoping Trent Alexander-Arnold can avoid a yellow card.\n(Image: Getty)\nIf Alexander-Arnold was to miss the return leg it would likely mean that James Milner is tasked with stopping Vinicius Jr, who already has four goals in the competition so far and would be a difficult prospect for the 37-year-old. Joe Gomez could move across from centre-back, but Klopp has often preferred Milner over Gomez in that role when Alexander-Arnold is absent.\nAside from Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool have six other players who have received one booking in the Champions League so far this season. Milner, Virgil van Dijk, Gomez, Darwin Nunez, Ibrahima Konate, Cody Gakpo and Joel Matip would miss a potential quarter-final should they be booked in both legs against Real Madrid and the Reds advance past the holders. Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, Ferland Mendy, Lucas Vasquez and Toni Kroos each have one card to their name.\nDON'T MISS",
